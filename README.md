# Libft Project README
## Overview
The Libft project marks the inception of your journey into C programming, emphasizing the creation of your very own C library. This foundational project aims to equip you with a collection of reusable functions that will be indispensable throughout your C programming assignments.  
By reimplementing several standard C library functions and adding a set of utility functions, you lay the groundwork for understanding fundamental programming concepts, memory management, and data manipulation.

## Key Components
__Libc Functions__: Reimplementation of essential C library functions to grasp their workings and utilities, such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and character testing.  
__Additional Functions__: A set of utility functions developed to extend the library's functionality, including substring creation, string joining, and list manipulation.  
__Bonus Functions__: Advanced manipulations of lists, adding, removing, and iterating over elements, designed to challenge and refine your programming skills further.  

## Skills Acquired
Through the Libft project and its custom additions, you gain a deep understanding of:  
- __C Programming Fundamentals__: Mastery of basic C syntax, data types, and control structures.  
- __Memory Management__: Proficient in dynamic memory allocation, management, and understanding memory leaks and their prevention.  
- __Data Structures__: Implementation and manipulation of basic data structures, including linked lists and arrays, for efficient data handling.  
- __Algorithmic Thinking__: Developing algorithms for string manipulation, data conversion, and mathematical computations.  
- __Problem Solving__: Applying logical and analytical skills to solve complex problems, crucial for advancing in C programming and software development.  
- __Software Engineering Practices__: Writing clean, maintainable code following best practices, preparing for collaborative and professional software development projects.  

## Custom Additions
Beyond the mandatory and bonus parts, custom functionalities were introduced to address specific needs encountered in subsequent projects.  
These additions include advanced mathematical operations, string manipulations, and data structures designed for more complex problem-solving scenarios:  
Structured data types for 2D and 3D point representations.  
Utility functions for string array manipulation, base conversion, and input parsing.  
Mathematical and geometric calculations essential for graphics programming and data analysis.  

## Usage
Clone the repository to include the libsft in your projects.  
Utilize the Makefile to compile the library, incorporating the provided and custom functions into your applications.
Refer to the libsft.h header for function prototypes and structures available for use.
